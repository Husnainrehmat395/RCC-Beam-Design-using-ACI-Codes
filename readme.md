# Beam Design Calculation Tool

This is a simple C++ program to perform **beam design calculations** for reinforced concrete beams. It calculates the **required area of steel**, checks **strain compatibility**, and verifies **moment capacity** for the given beam dimensions and material properties.

## Project Description

This tool helps structural engineers to automate the process of calculating the required reinforcement for a beam design. The program checks:

1. **Strain Compatibility**: Ensures the strain in the steel bar is within allowable limits.
2. **Moment Capacity**: Verifies that the beam can resist the applied moment.
3. **Required Area of Steel**: Calculates the area of steel needed based on the applied moment and beam properties.

## Requirements

- **C++ compiler** (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio)
- A basic understanding of reinforced concrete beam design.

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beam-design.git
